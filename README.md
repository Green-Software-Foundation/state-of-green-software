## Editing Content

This project is a static website based on the project https://docusaurus.io, you can find more information about docusaurus here: https://docusaurus.io/docs

The `docs` folder contains all of the material in this project, editing any file there in the `main` branch will update the website. If you are only interested in editing content on the website then you should not need to leave the `docs` folder.

The documentation files use a format called markdown and they end in `.md` which supports certain basic styling features like so: https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features

## Developing Locally

To edit this project on your local machine and see the output as it would be rendered on the website you will need `node` at least version 14 installed.

`npm install`

Then to run the project locally type

`npm start`

and visit https://localhost:3000 in your favorite browser or whatever the command above prints out in the terminal.

## Site Configuration

To edit attributes of the website, customize the menu, sidebar and footer for example, you will need to edit the `docusaurus.config.js` file, more information about the options that are present there can be found here: https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/docusaurus-config
