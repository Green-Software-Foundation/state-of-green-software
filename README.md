## Editing Content

This project is a static website based on the project https://docusaurus.io, you can find more information about docusaurus here: https://docusaurus.io/docs

The `docs` folder contains all of the material in this project, editing any file there in the `main` branch will update the website. If you are only interested in editing content on the website then you should not need to leave the `docs` folder.

The documentation files use a format called markdown and they end in `.md` which supports certain basic styling features like so: https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features

and visit https://localhost:3000 in your favorite browser or whatever the command above prints out in the terminal.
