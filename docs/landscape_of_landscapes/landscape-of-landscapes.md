https://datasets.thegreenwebfoundation.org/

### Author
Green Web Foundation

### Description
The Green Web Foundation regularly publishes a dataset of green domain names, and who hosts them. We refer to this as the green domains dataset. Every check of a website in the The Green Web Foundation platform is recorded in a table called greenchecks. As of Februrary 2021, this table is more than 3 billion rows long. For this reason, the dataset the Green Web Foundation publishes contains a smaller table, greendomains, listing the urls, and their status, with pertinent metadata.

## Regulatory Overviews

### Title
Regulatory framework for e-Applications (Regulatory framework for Over-the-Top (OTT) services)

### Publication
https://datahub.itu.int/

### Author
International Telecommunications Union

### Description
An overview of the existence and scope of regulatory frameworks on e-applications around the world. The regulatory data is collected first-hand from ITU Member State administrations via an annual [regulatory survey](https://www.itu.int/net4/itu-d/icteye-data/static/pdf/ITU_Telecommunication-Regulatory-Survey-2020_E.pdf), which dates back to 1994. The survey covers a wide range of ICT policy and regulatory issues and allows to track the latest ICT trends and evolutions. Each year the survey is adapted in order to reflect changes in the sector. The latest survery version (2020) includes the question `Has your country adopted any policy/legislation/regulation related to e-applications and/or m-applications?` and if yes, asks which areas the regulation covers. One of the options is `Environment`. The source data is not publicly accessible, but it is exposed via the ITU's public datahub. The url listed here indicates the percentage of countries with environmentally focused e-applications regulations, standing at 12% as of 2020, based on 129 countries out of 196 countries. This indicates 15 countries have environmental regulations of e-applications.

Sustainability

Jakub Swacha

### Description
A scoping review of literature on sustainable software models, based on 41 works extracted from an initial set of 178 query results from four bibliographic data providers. The relevant literature is mapped using five categories (model scope, purpose, covered sustainability aspects, verification or validation, and the economic category of the country of research), allowing us to identify recent trends and research gaps, which can be addressed in future work.
