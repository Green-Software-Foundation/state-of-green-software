- Latest academic research estimating the size of the problem and the impact of software (interview) \
- What are the correct most up-to-date stats we should all be quoting? (survey)

- Who are the key actors, the industry bodies, advocacy groups, regulatory bodies, and environmental coalitions? (desktop)

- What figures can best describe the current state of green software? (desktop?) \
- How does the data differ between regions, sectors, languages, etc? (survey)

- What are the future (global) trends related to green software? (interviews, survey) \
- What high-impact policy events are on the horizon in the industry? (desktop) \
- What upcoming regulation is on the horizon that impacts green software? (interviews, survey)

- From the Perspective of Executive Leadership (all interviews) \
- What is the interest in exploring this space? (more detailed than in the executive summary) \
- What challenges are there to adopting green software at scale? \
- What narratives motivate and convince people to take action? \

From the Perspective of Software Practitioners (all survey) \
- How aware are software practitioners about green software? \
- How important is it at their work? Is it a priority? \
- What are the pain points / blockers? \
- What (open-source) tooling is available, what is the most popular and where are the gaps? \
- What training, certification and other knowledge resources are available?

The latest academic research estimating the size of the problem and the impact of software.

How aware are software practitioners about green software?

How important is it at their work? Is it a priority?

What challenges are there to adopting green software at scale?

What successes have there been, and what technologies and conversations show the most promise so far?

What narratives motivate and convince people to take action?

How does the data differ between regions, sectors, languages, etc?

What tooling is the most popular?

What open-source tooling is the most popular?

What is the interest in exploring this space?



* What are the current state and future trends related to green software?
* What is the state of the art regarding green software research, including the correct most up-to-date stats we should all be quoting?
* What is the user experience regarding green software from the perspective of software practitioners and executive leadership?
* Who are the key actors in the green software ecosystem, the industry bodies, advocacy groups, regulatory bodies, and environmental coalitions?
* What high-impact policy events and upcoming regulation is on the horizon that impacts green software?
* What green software open-source tooling is currently available, and where are the gaps?

The State of Green Software report will highlight gaps in the green software ecosystem and drive investment toward filling those gaps. It will help people understand what kind of motivations will result in the best outcomes. It will better prepare organizations for upcoming regulations and policies. It will reduce duplication of effort by shining a light on the activity’s key actors are already engaged in

"To really make an impact on emissions reduction in the tech sector, we need coordinated action on policy strategies that are actionable, scalable, and in line with climate science." - Co-Chair GSF Policy Working Group, Elise Zelechowski.

“The State of Green Software Report is something I wished I had four years ago when I first started to explore this space. If you want to convince your leadership to invest in your green software project, send them your proposal and attach this report as the proof point.” – Asim Hussain, Executive Director @ Green Software Foundation
