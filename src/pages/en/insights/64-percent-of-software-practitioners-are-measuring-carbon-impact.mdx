Developers and other ICT stakeholders are already working towards climate goals. According to the [SOGS survey](../survey), 15.6% of over 2,000 software practitioners work for an organization that always measures the carbon impact of their software, and 49.3% say that their organization sometimes measures the carbon impact of their software.

Many software practitioners are taking steps to decrease the carbon impact of their software: 11.5% say they always do this, and 44.8% say they sometimes do it. In terms of the type of measures underway to decarbonize software, 24.7% say they do it by creating energy-efficient software, 20.93% stated by developing software that can run on older hardware or devices, 35.2% shared by maximizing the utilization of their hardware, and 44.6% said by minimizing the amount of data their software sends and receives.

With positive momentum, it’s no surprise that green software has developed name recognition despite being a relatively new field. The [SOGS survey](../survey) further emphasized this shift, with **13.5%** of respondents saying they were very familiar with green software and **53.5%** stating they were somewhat familiar.

Companies and other organizations need tools to reduce, measure, and report their scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions according to the [GHG Protocol Corporate Standard](https://ghgprotocol.org/corporate-standard). Scope 3 emissions are especially [difficult to quantify and manage](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/insights/articles/three-ways-clean-tech-can-help-you-tackle-scope-three-emissions), but green software can help with those efforts. BCG’s 2022 report on [AI for the Planet ](https://web-assets.bcg.com/ff/d7/90b70d9f405fa2b67c8498ed39f3/ai-for-the-planet-bcg-report-july-2022.pdf)states that AI can help with measuring and reporting carbon emissions. Encouragingly, **53%** of respondents from the [SOGS survey](../survey) said they or their employer measured the environmental impact of their software at least some of the time.
