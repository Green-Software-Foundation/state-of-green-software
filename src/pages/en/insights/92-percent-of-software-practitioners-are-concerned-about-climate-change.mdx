The [SOGS survey](../survey) indicates that over 2,000 **software practitioners and other stakeholders have climate change top of mind, with 62% reporting they are very concerned and 30% saying they are concerned.**

Other studies show similar results. For example, a [Yale University survey](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/what-do-video-gamers-think-about-global-warming/toc/2/) of over 2,000 gamers revealed that the majority of gamers (73%) think global warming is happening, and 70% are somewhat or very concerned about climate change.

Data from both surveys correspond to the general public’s increasing concern about climate change, as indicated in previous studies. A [2019 Pew study](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/Pew-Research-Center_Global-Threats-2018-Report_2019-02-10.pdf) of 23 countries showed that the percentage of people who said climate change was a major threat to their country increased from 56% in 2013 to 67% in 2018. [Some studies](https://news.gallup.com/poll/234314/global-warming-age-gap-younger-americans-worried.aspx) have found that younger generations are more likely to worry about the climate. Our survey respondents fall on the younger side, with a large majority under 45 years of age; 6.8% are 18-24, 37.65% are 25-34, and 33.82% are 35-44.
