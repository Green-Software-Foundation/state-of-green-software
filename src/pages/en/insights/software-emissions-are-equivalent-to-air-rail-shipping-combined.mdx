Software-related CO2 emissions account for [4-5% of global emissions](https://www.cell.com/patterns/pdfExtended/S2666-3899(21)00188-4). This is equivalent to the emissions of all aviation, shipping, and rail combined.

The current [gold standard paper](https://www.cell.com/patterns/pdfExtended/S2666-3899(21)00188-4) on the climate and transformative impact of ICT indicates that precise estimates of software-related CO2 emissions vary according to methodology, but generally agree as to the main sources: digital devices, data centers, and networks. Software development itself can be energy intensive, such as [training LLMs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922) (large language models) and [other AI models](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/ais-carbon-footprint-problem). This is why [Hugging Face calculates](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/11/14/1063192/were-getting-a-better-idea-of-ais-true-carbon-footprint/) the carbon cost of AI using a life cycle analysis, taking into account both training and use over time along with the larger computing infrastructure.

According to _[Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2020/09/how-green-is-your-software)_, by 2040, software is expected to account for 14% of the world’s carbon footprint. It is clear that reducing emissions from software will be a crucial part of meeting the targets outlined by the [2022 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, “Mitigation of Climate Change.”](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-3/)
