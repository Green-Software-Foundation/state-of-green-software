According to the SOGS survey, 35% of over 2,000 software practitioners shared that they and their organization never measure the carbon impact of software. Though this reflects a minority of the population surveyed, it shows that there needs to be an investment in resources to affect change.

[ESG](https://hbr.org/2022/12/2022-a-tumultuous-year-in-esg-and-sustainability) and other developments in the regulatory environment will likely require more organizations to measure the carbon impact of their software. In parallel, an increased understanding of an individualâ€™s capacity to affect change could also build momentum toward a green software transition.

Developers are passionate about making a difference and using their technical skills to mitigate climate change. Not only do they join existing efforts in their workplaces, but they often have ideas for developing sustainability-related projects. One [survey](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/Green-Tech/The-rise-of-the-green-software-developer) found that 54% out of 500 developers want to be part of the greater good and make a difference, with 94% indicating they have their own ideas for developing sustainability projects.
