Developers and other ICT stakeholders are already working towards climate goals. According to the SOGS survey, 15.6% of over 2,000 software practitioners work for an organization that always measures the carbon impact of their software, and 49.3% say that their organization sometimes measures the carbon impact of their software.

Many software practitioners are taking steps to decrease the carbon impact of their software: 11.5% say they always do this, and 44.8% say they sometimes do it. In terms of the type of measures underway to decarbonize software, 24.7% say they do it by creating energy-efficient software, 20.93% stated by developing software that can run on older hardware or devices, 35.2% shared by maximizing the utilization of their hardware, and 44.6% said by minimizing the amount of data their software sends and receives.

With positive momentum, it’s no surprise green software has developed name recognition despite being a relatively new field. The SOGS survey further emphasized this shift with  13.5% of respondents saying they were very familiar with green software and 53.5% stating they were somewhat familiar. Software practitioners have some awareness of  green software–at minimum, practitioners recognize the term.
