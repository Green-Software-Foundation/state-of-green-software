As the [President of Microsoft said](https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2022-11-02/microsofts-president-warns-of-talent-shortage-for-tackling-climate-change) in a November 2022 statement, companies will have trouble meeting their net-zero goals unless they begin systematically training their employees in sustainability by bringing in instructors, formal training modules, and continuing education programs. Likewise, developers need buy-in from management to focus their efforts on green software. Passionate volunteers actively working on carbon-aware and energy-efficient technology need support to implement and scale their technology.

For example, one SOGS survey respondent shared, “I want to do it all but I don't know how yet.” Another respondent said, “I don't do much yet because of a lack of tools, KPIs, and customer willingness.” Another respondent shared that they did not take any steps to reduce emissions because their employer did not see the value.

It is evident that there is much work to be done to fix the knowledge and tooling gap and to educate customers about the commercial viability of green software and the business case behind applying green software principles. With C-suite input and management support, software practitioners will be better positioned to develop the tools and solutions needed to meet climate goals.
