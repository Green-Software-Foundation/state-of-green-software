At this moment, green software research is concentrated in China, which is the global leader in the area of green computing, followed by the USA, India, UK and Australia. Latin America, Africa and the Middle East produce the least research in this field. More research is needed in specific regional and local contexts that consider a region’s unique regulatory landscapes, energy infrastructures, and social and environmental factors. There are small-scale research findings from specific geographic locations, such as this study in Malaysia.

Results from the SOGS Survey suggest software practitioners need more resources in various languages. One respondent noted, “there is almost no content in Spanish about green software.” Several other respondents mentioned regional differences, taking into account that the regulatory landscape looks different in different parts of the world. One person noted that the level of awareness when it comes to Green Software varies by country and that in their country (Poland), awareness is quite low.

More research is needed, along with more educational resources in a number of languages. Field builders can consider translating available training, research and use cases into other languages, prioritizing regions like Latin America and the Middle East where existing information and insight is limited.
